# Exam Project Stage 1: Business

## Objective: Foundation of a business case

### 1. By brainstorming and browsing sources of inspiration collect ideas and define one or more business or social domains, where data analysis can bring a value.  

During our brainstorm we had the following ideas:
- Stock market:  
Is it possible to find trends in stocks/indices and is it possible for outside events to affect the price action.
- Gaming:   
What parameters does it take to make a good game and can we predict how well a game will sell.
- Programmer:  
What paramters (programming language, age, experience, location, education, gender) has an effect on a developers salary.
- Health:  
Can we predict whether a person will get a specific health issue (heart disease, diabetes, cancer) when looking at their current health factors.
- Sport:  
Can we predict whether a football team will win when looking at their current lineup.  
- Space:  
Can we classify whether we have identified a new planet or is it an already discovered planet.

### 2. Search Internet for sources of information, related to your ideas.
We will be more precise when we have chosen a subject but overall we have looked at the following sources for gathering data:
- Stock market:  
[Kaggle for dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
[NYSE for data and news](https://www.nyse.com/index)  
[CNBC for news](https://www.cnbc.com/world/?region=world)

3. ### Choose one of the ideas and formulate context, purpose, research questions, and hypotheses for a data science problem definition.


4.    Prepare the technical platform needed for researching and developing the problem solution:

a.    select and install software tools and development environments

b.   create a Github repository, which will host all project components during all stages of the development and implementation process.

c.    create and upload a .md file as an initial release of the project, which contains title and brief annotation of your project, in minimum four sentences, telling:

路      what is in the focus of your interest?

路      why is it interesting?

路      which outcome do you expect from your research?

路      who may be a user of the results?

Submit the Github repository link in Peergrade.

Deadline: 29<sup>th</sup> April 2022
