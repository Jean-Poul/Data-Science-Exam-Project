# Stage 3: Artificial Intelligence  
  
### Objective: Using the data and the exploration results for building predictive models
### Extend the analysis by implementing machine learning or deep learning methods and algorithms.

### 1. Select at least two relevant AI methods that could solve the problem.
a. train models by use of supervised and unsupervised methods, neural networks or graphs
- We have chosen to train our data with three different models, to see the differences between them. The three models are as follows: K-nearest neighbour, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and decision tree classifier.  
See the jupyter notebook.  

b. test the models created by the learners on test data sets to predict the output  
- See the jupyter notebook.  

c. validate the models with new data sets  
- See the jupyter notebook.  

### 2. Select appropriate measures for assessing the quality of your models  
a. calculate appropriate measures to prove the validity of the models  
- See the jupyter notebook.  
### 3. Iterate the operations listed above several times, trying to improve the quality of the models, as much as possible
### 4. Compare the results of the validation and select the best performing model. Store the trained model in a file for further implementation.  
- See the jupyter notebook
### 5. Integrate the predictive model with the other modules in the scenario as appropriate, in a new AI prototype of your product.  
- See the jupyter notebook.
