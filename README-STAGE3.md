# Stage 3: Artificial Intelligence  
  
### Objective: Using the data and the exploration results for building predictive models
### Extend the analysis by implementing machine learning or deep learning methods and algorithms.

### 1. Select at least two relevant AI methods that could solve the problem.
a. train models by use of supervised and unsupervised methods, neural networks or graphs
- We have chosen to train our data with four different models, to be able to see the different performance between them. We will be using supervised and unsupervised learning.   
The three supervised models are as follows: K-nearest neighbour, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and decision tree classifier.  
We have chosen to build an unsupervised model with K-means.
See the jupyter notebook for further details.  

b. test the models created by the learners on test data sets to predict the output  
- See the jupyter notebook.  

c. validate the models with new data sets  
- See the jupyter notebook.  

### 2. Select appropriate measures for assessing the quality of your models  
a. calculate appropriate measures to prove the validity of the models  
- See the jupyter notebook.  
### 3. Iterate the operations listed above several times, trying to improve the quality of the models, as much as possible  
- See the jupyter notebook.  
### 4. Compare the results of the validation and select the best performing model. Store the trained model in a file for further implementation.  
- See the jupyter notebook
### 5. Integrate the predictive model with the other modules in the scenario as appropriate, in a new AI prototype of your product.  
- See the jupyter notebook.
