# Stage 3: Artificial Intelligence  
  
#### Objective: Using the data and the exploration results for building predictive models
Extend the analysis by implementing machine learning or deep learning methods and algorithms.
1. Select at least two relevant AI methods that could solve the problem.
a. train models by use of supervised and unsupervised methods, neural networks or graphs
b. test the models created by the learners on test data sets to predict the output
c. validate the models with new data sets
2. Select appropriate measures for assessing the quality of your models
a. calculate appropriate measures to prove the validity of the models
3. Iterate the operations listed above several times, trying to improve the quality of the models, as 
much as possible
4. Compare the results of the validation and select the best performing model. Store the trained 
model in a file for further implementation.
5. Integrate the predictive model with the other modules in the scenario as appropriate, in a new AI 
prototype of your product.
Export your solution files to Github and Peergrade.
