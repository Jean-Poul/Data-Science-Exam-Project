# Stage 5: Exam Project  

### Objective: The final product of your research and development work during the semester is presented and discussed at the exam.  

#### NOTE: We have only uploaded two datasets of all our viewed datasets since they are to big in size to upload to GitHub.  
The datasets can be shown to the exam if needed or found through our links in [Stage 2: Data acquisition and exploration](https://github.com/Jean-Poul/Data-Science-Exam-Project/blob/main/README-STAGE2.md)  

As a pre-requisite, you need to 
- have collected 80% of the study points, given for fulfilment of the semester assignments, 
according the curriculum  
This requirement has been met by all group members.  

- have submitted to Wiseflow one page of text in pdf format, on which stay
o the title of the project
o the names of the team members developing it
o extended resume of the project statement and solution
o the link to the Github repository, where the project solution can be found
The project solution hosted on Github includes the problem statement, motivation, theoretical 
foundation, argumentation of choices, design, code, artefacts, outcomes, and implementation 
instructions, as appropriate.  
It is important to enable reproduction of the project functionality and results.  
    
Details about our project and a guide on how to run our model can be found on our landing page: [Project details and instructions](https://github.com/Jean-Poul/Data-Science-Exam-Project/blob/main/README.md)
