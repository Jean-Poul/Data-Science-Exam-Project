# Exam Project Stage 4: Visualisation  
  
### Objective: Present the process and results of the analysis in human-understandable form  
### Extend your solution with a design of advanced visualisation of business data scenarios and results  

### 1. Deploy the model on localhost web server   
Our deployment solution can be found in the notebook  

### 2. Create simple interface for accessing and using the model    
This can be viewed when running our notebook  

### 3. Design alternative/complementing interface, which provides extended user experience  
a. Consider applying animation, 3D visualisation, and VR/AR/MR (extended reality) techniques.    
b. If impossible to implement, draw your ideas on paper or digital surface and add the image to your project assets.  
    
We have applied two html pages in the visualization folder. These candlestick charts are interactive and a user can zoom in on specific timeframes or hover the mouse over a candlestick to view price action and a news headline attached on the day.  
On the candlestick chart there has been attached moving averages to be able to use technical analysis on the given timeframe (two year chart).   
Furthermore we have attached two dashboard which can give an overview over our focus. The first dashboard looks at data regarding volume compared to gain or loss on the day. The second dashboard looks at data regarding news headlines compared to gain or loss on the day.  


### 4. Elaborate on the benefits of applying the above-mentioned visualisation techniques for data analytics  
Visualizing data can help data scientists to better understand the data. It can be a quick way to find outliers in the data set and also view how introducing new parameters can shape the data. Furthermore, it is a way to communicate relationships within the data set. Visualizing the data can also be a bridge between the different departments in a project, which for example can help the business and developer side of a business to understand the presented data in the same way and thereby not have misunderstandings further down the path of development. By doing so both sides of the table are able to get a clear understanding of what the data is representing and what findings have been made. This can be done by diagrams or charts. A diagram can be viewed as a sketch to show how something works or to show a relationship between the parts as a whole. A chart can be viewed as a type of diagram (or graph) which represents a set of numerical or qualitative data points. Examples on this could be to use a scatterplot to present relationships between the data or use a histogram to present the frequency of the data within a range. Throughout our notebook we have shown several ways of representing our data and showed how visualization can be used to explore data initially or even explore results. Lastly, we have made two diagrams where we chart price action, volume, and news attached to the day in what is known as a candlestick chart. These diagrams are interactive and can be viewed in html format. The diagrams are formed out of our own data set one, which has news titles attached, and out of Yahoo finans data to be able to demonstrate how it would look when using more recently gathered data.    
  
Many visualization plots are shown as two dimensional but since many data sets have more than just two dimensions, also known as features, some insight might get lost in translation. Therefore, visualizing data in 3D can help a user to get a better understanding of the data. This can be done by means of 3D plots, which we have shown in our K-Means sections, or by 3D software applications like Unity. By taking advantage of this software the user experience and exploration can be enhanced. This can even be taken a step further by using virtual reality, VR, to get fully immersed by stepping into the data. This can be a fun way of making a game out of data exploration. Overall visualizing data gives not only insight into the data but also allows users to get a quick understanding of what has been analyzed and give a non-technical user a fair chance for participating. We have used visualization to not only give ourselves an overview of the trend of a stock but also to give our readers an insight to our thought process. We have also made dashboards that can give an insight into a potential relationship between volume and if the stock had a gain or loss on the given day and if a news headline has had an effect on the stock. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that in our case, data and visualization can give an objective view of performance of our models and serve as an foundation for further dialog. All this combined can in the end help speed up the discovering process to gain insight and help along the decision process. This is the power of storytelling through visualization. It has to be said that visualization tells what is happening but not why it is happening.
