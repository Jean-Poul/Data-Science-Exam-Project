## Brief introduction:  

## Stage 2: Data
#### Objective: Data acquisition and exploration 
Based on the ideas and assumptions defined at the previous stage of your business case analysis,
create the first prototype of your solution implementation.
1. Searching Internet and other media, find relevant data sources that can be used in your 
experiments.
2. Collect and integrate the data sources in shared repository by either ETL (Extract Transform Load) 
or ELT (Extract Load Transform).
3. Explore the data by applying methods of descriptive and inferential statistics. 
a. design data processing scenario 
b. decide on data processing parameters

4. Prepare the data for machine learning analysis, ensuring that the data is:
a. meaningful – describes relevant and correctly measured features and observations
b. sufficient – describes various cases and feature occurrences, decided by testing
c. shaped – presented in a structure, appropriate for processing by machine learning 
algorithms
d. cleaned – repaired from missing values and outliners
e. scaled – transform data distributions in comparable scales, when necessary
f. engineered – analyse all features and select the most informative for further processing
